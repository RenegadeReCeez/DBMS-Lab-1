1. 

Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.


2.

Sufficient knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey.

The distinction between a primary key and candidate key is deficient. Remember
that a primary key is also a candidate key. 


3.

Good example of datatypes and nulls. However, you started your essay with a
question without a question mark, bummer.


4.

Very good explanations about the rules.
