SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.
Incorrect query
- You are hard-coding things. This will only work for this specific snapshot of
  the database and not for further snapshots. You need to use 'Dallas' as your
  baseline. Don't do this ever again. Sneaky!


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!
