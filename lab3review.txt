Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth' AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



2. List the name and city of agents named Smith.

Incorrect output
- You are giving, [city,name] but you were asked to give [name,city]


In general: 

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!
   ERROR:  syntax error at or near "select"
