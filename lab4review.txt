Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here



3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- Logic is wrong                                                                     


4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

Incorrect query
- WTH?


5. Get the ids of products not ordered by any customers who placed any order
through agent a07 in pid order from highest to lowest.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not include -actual- check constraints examples, just descriptions of
  them. 


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Be careful with the way you are using parenthesis. They were not
- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted queries compatible with the other group's database, with Alan's
  section. So, I am going to investigate this further. If I determine you are
  cheating, you will receive a failing grade in this assignment.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
